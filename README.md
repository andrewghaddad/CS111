This is a compilation of all coursework done for a computer science class during my time at Rutgers University- New Brunswick. Within this class I learned the fundamental concepts in programming that include:
  - Design algorithmic solutions to problems.
  - Develop, implement, test, and document program code.
  - Analyze program code for correctness, efficiency, equivalency, and errors.
  - Demonstrate an understanding of object-oriented methodology in program development.
  - Select appropriate data types/structures for use in a given application.
  - Design and modify data structures capable of insertion, deletion, search, copy, and other related tasks.
  - Demonstrate an understanding of searching and sorting algorithms.

During this class, we learned the programming language java and programming topics that include:
  - _Editing_, _compiling_, and _debugging_ a program.
  - Working with built In _Data Types_.
  - Using command-line arguments that prompts the user to _input_ data into a Java program.
  - Using various methods to _output_ information in Java program.
  - Working with _booleans_, logical/ relational _operators_, and the _math_ _class_ in java programs.
  - Implementing code that has _conditionals_ and _loops_ involving if, if-else, while, for, do-while statments. 
  - Ability to declare, create, initialize, traverse, and manipulate _one-dimensional(1D)_ and _two-dimensional (2D)_ _arrays_.
  - Utilize different types of _input and output_ classes and methods in a Java program.
  - Working with _functions/ modules_ and being able to write/ call functions.
  - Implementing, tracing, and testing _recursive functions_.
  - Using _Object-oriented programming_ concepts that include the creation and use of _data types_. 
  - Preforming _algorithm complexity analysis_ to understand, explain, and detirmine efficiency of algorithms.
  - Understanding _searching and sorting algorithms_.
